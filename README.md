# Wine Quality Analysis

This project explores the factors influencing wine quality using the WineQT dataset. 
We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between 
different wine characteristics and their overall quality rating.

## Dataset

The [WineQT dataset](link-to-dataset) is used for this analysis. It contains information 
about various physicochemical properties of red and white wines, along with a quality 
score assigned by human tasters.

## Methodology

The analysis is performed using Python with the following libraries:

- pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib: for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
- seaborn: for building on top of matplotlib and providing visually appealing statistical graphics

The code performs the following steps:

1. Data loading and cleaning:
    - Load the WineQT dataset from a CSV file.
    - Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., 'id').
    - Handle missing values (if any).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for each variable.
    - Visualize the distribution of variables using histograms and box plots.
    - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
    - Explore the relationship between wine quality and other variables using scatter plots and bar plots.

## Code Description

The code is organized into a Jupyter Notebook (`wine_quality_analysis.ipynb`) with clear comments 
explaining each step. The notebook is divided into sections corresponding to the 
methodology described above.

## Results

The analysis reveals [mention key findings and insights from your EDA]. 
For example, you might find that certain variables (e.g., alcohol content, acidity) 
have a strong correlation with wine quality. 
Include visualizations to support your findings and make the results more impactful.
